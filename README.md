## Book-Search-Engine

## Description

The Book Search Engine is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). Initially developed with a RESTful API, it has been refactored to use a GraphQL API powered by Apollo Server. This application allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite books to a database, and manage their saved books.

Why

This project demonstrates the ability to build a modern, scalable web application with the MERN stack, incorporating GraphQL for efficient data querying and manipulation. It also showcases user authentication and deployment using modern tools like Render and MongoDB Atlas.

How

- The application uses the following technologies and tools:

- React: For the front-end user interface.

- Apollo Client: For managing GraphQL queries and mutations from the front end.

- Node.js/Express.js: For the server-side logic and API.

- Apollo Server: For implementing the GraphQL API.

- MongoDB: For the database.

- Render: For deployment.

- MongoDB Atlas: For cloud-hosted database management.

- The main features include:

- Searching for books via the Google Books API.

- User authentication for account creation and login.

- Saving and managing favorite books.

- Deploying the app with a cloud-based backend.
